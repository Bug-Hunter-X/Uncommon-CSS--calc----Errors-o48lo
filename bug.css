The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes it doesn't work as expected due to unexpected operator precedence or unit mismatches.  For example, using `calc(100% - 50px)` works, but `calc(100% - 50)` might not work because the second value lacks a unit.  Also, ensure parentheses are used correctly to control the order of operations. Another common issue is forgetting to include a space between the operator and the operand.
