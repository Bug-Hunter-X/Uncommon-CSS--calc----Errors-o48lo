# Uncommon CSS `calc()` Errors

This repository demonstrates some uncommon errors that can occur when using the `calc()` function in CSS.  The `calc()` function is powerful, but requires careful attention to detail regarding operator precedence, units, and parenthesis use.

The `bug.css` file contains examples of the errors.  The `bugSolution.css` file provides corrected versions with explanations.

Common issues include:

* **Missing Units:**  The `calc()` function requires units on all values (e.g., `px`, `%`, `em`).
* **Operator Precedence:**  Parentheses `()` should be used to control the order of operations.
* **Spaces:** Ensure spaces are used between operators and operands.

This repository provides simple, practical examples to help avoid these errors.
